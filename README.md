# Centralized-Role-Control
This code is a Solidity smart contract that implements a centralized Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
Introducing a decentralized solution for managing access control in supply chain and value chain systems. Our contract, built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, provides a centralized role-based access control mechanism. The contract allows the root admin to define, remove, and manage roles for users and admins, and also provides protection against data dumping.

Our contract is optimized for gas usage and includes functions to add and remove admins, declare and remove roles, add and remove users, and list all associated roles for an address. With this solution, supply chain and value chain participants can efficiently manage access control to ensure the security and privacy of their products and data.

It allows for the declaration of roles, assignment of roles to users, and revocation of roles. The contract provides several functions for adding, removing, and listing roles and users. The contract also includes some security features to protect against unauthorized access, such as an AdminGuard modifier that prevents an address associated with the "admin" role from being assigned any other role. Overall, this contract can be used to manage access to various functions or features within a decentralized application (dApp) or blockchain-based system.
